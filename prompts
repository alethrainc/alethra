Padding between  content on desktop 3rem and on mobile 2rem
make sure to check all inner margins and paddings, verticalwhite space between sections can't be more than 3rem desktop and 2rem mobile conbined, vertical should take in count both sections to create the right spacing. Remember the left alinged design system for headings and texts
